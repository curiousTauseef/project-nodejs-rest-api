# Build a REST API with Node.js & Express

## Background
At [Microverse](http://www.microverse.org/), we are passionate about helping people learn by working on real-world projects where **we tell you WHAT to build, but never HOW to build it**. Think about it as if we were your Product Managers.

We also run a [training program for remote software developers](http://www.microverse.org/), where students learn by doing remote pair programming as part of small distributed teams, all while working on freelance and open source projects. 

## Introduction
In this project you will learn how to build a production-ready REST API using Node.js and Express.js. You will work in a real-world project for a fictional company that requires your help.

The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements that you will need to implement.

## Tools you will use
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- npm
- Mocha
- Chai
- Passport.js
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

## The Project
Emvents Inc., a (fictional) tech company based in South Africa, has requested your help with a product they are building. Emvents Inc. wants to create a mobile app to help people find the best free events in Africa and help organizers reach millions of potential attendees.

The company will build the mobile application for iOS and Android, but they need someone to build the API that they will use as backend. This is where you come to play. In this project, you will build a REST API using Node.js for them.
